# Heart-Failure-Prediction-Analysis
Since the pandemic, physical activity of individuals has drastically reduced as they are confined to the comfort of their homes. That leads to increased rate of lifestyle diseases, especially heart issues. It is important to keep our heart healthy as 31% of deaths in the world is due to heart issues.
This repository contains a heart failure prediction model that analyses user input data from a simple lab report to alert you of heart failure risk.
## Machine Learning Model
* Binary classifier built on Scikit-Learn currently predicts heart status as 'High Risk' or 'No Risk'.
* Framework : Scikit-Learn( Version: 1.0 )
* Algorithm : Random Forest Classifier
* Validation Accuracy : 80.00%

### How to train
Upload the python notebook in the folder **'model'** to Google Colab and run each cell for training the model.
## How to use:
* Clone repository to local machine and run app.py in folder web app or open https://heart-status.herokuapp.com/ to take a quick look.
* You can make changes in app.py and web-app folder and host it to use as an api in any application.
